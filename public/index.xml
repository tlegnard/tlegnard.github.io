      <description>Draft:
Note that some of this article was written with some assitance with ChatGPT, paragraphs drafted using the tool are preceded with the prompt used to generate the content, and marked as such at the end, although there may have been edits or revisions applied by the author.
Working in the education technology space in the advent of ChatGPT has been interesting if not also irritating. Like any other bubble, people tend to take a lot of stock in new technology that seems to be easy to use and disrupt how our society operates.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Tom, I&amp;rsquo;m a Data Engineer at Unizin. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a data professional for 7 years, but have been moving closer to identifying as a full-fledged software developer in the &amp;ldquo;big-data&amp;rdquo; domain in recent months. The title &amp;ldquo;Data Engineer&amp;rdquo; usually alludes to someone who builds and manages data pipelines, however my greatest passion is building and maintaining distributed systems.
Most of my cloud experience is in Google Cloud Platform, but I have dabbled with Azure and AWS services.</description>
