I'm Tom, I'm a Data Engineer at [Unizin](https://unizin.org). I've been a data professional for 7 years, but have been moving closer to identifying as a full-fledged software developer in the "big-data" domain in recent months. The title "Data Engineer" usually alludes to someone who builds and manages data pipelines, however my greatest passion is building and maintaining distributed systems.

Most of my cloud experience is in Google Cloud Platform, but I have dabbled with Azure and AWS services. I'm proficient in Python, SQL, Bash and familiar with GoLang, R.

In terms of frameworks and tools, I work daily with Docker, K8s, and Apache Airflow. I have a lot of experience building scalable data pipelines but I am passionate about learning new things and building back-end systems to support automation and services.

In my free time I play piano and make music on my computer. My wife Sarah and I have a photography business, feel free to [check it out](https://bookstmedia.com). We also have a cat named Brockley.
