I'm Tom, I'm a Data Architect at [Unizin](https://unizin.org). I've been a data professional for 7 years, my greatest passion in terms of technology is building and maintaining distributed systems.

Most of my cloud experience is in Google Cloud Platform, but I have dabbled with Azure and AWS services. I'm proficient in Python, SQL, Bash and familiar with GoLang, R.

In terms of frameworks and tools, I work daily with Docker, kubernetes, and Apache Airflow. I have a lot of experience building scalable data pipelines but I am passionate about learning new things and building back-end systems to support automation and services.

In my free time I play piano, bass, and make music on my computer. My wife Sarah and I have a photography business, feel free to [check it out](https://sarahandtomphoto.com).
