*Note that some of this article was written with some assitance with ChatGPT, paragraphs drafted using the tool are preceded with the prompt used to generate the content, and marked as such at the end, although there may have been edits or revisions applied by the author.*

Working in the education technology space in the advent of ChatGPT has been interesting if not also irritating. Like any other bubble, people tend to take a lot of stock in new technology that seems to be easy to use and disrupt how our society operates. In the higher-ed world, ChatGPT appears to be the ultimate reckoning. Many facutly fear the worst, rampant cheating (as if that wasn't already happening), loss in critical thinking, removal of the ability to judge studen't writing based on their ideas rather than their ability to put a prompt into an AI engine that gives them the answer.

I would argue this was already happening, and ChatGPT is just exposing something that academia has been ignorning since the internet has become mainstream: they are behind the times and aren't doing enough to adapt to both the challenges and conveniences that many students are exposed to.

The reality is that writing is hard, I'm struggling to even get a draft of this idea for an article that I have in my head and articulate it on paper. If students with heavy courseloads and withering attention spans are given the opportunity to offload some of the mental exertion needed to complete an assignment, do research, or write a paper, it would be stupid for them not to use all of the tools at their fingertips. ChatGPT is seen as a death blow to focused and concerted efforts from students, when it may actually be the advent of a whole system of bringing students to a higher level of thinking. ChatGPT removes the barrier of collecting notes and articulating thoughts for a student and allows them to get their ideas written faster, and they can focus on putting thoughts together and reinforcing what they are learning in lectures. In the age of Google and turnitin.com, students don't get a enough credit for hiding their cheating ways, when really they are just trying to get by. Using ChatGPT for a paper is an excellent example of a student capitilizing on behavior that Daniel Kahneman documents in *Thinking Fast and Slow*, where most humans have two main modes of thinking:

- System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
- System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.

Rather than try to belabor the point of trying to explain where ChatGPT plays into allowing humans to more quickly move from their system 1 impulses into their System 2 mode of thinking, I will let the AI do the work for me:

Prompt:
>Write a paragraph on how ChatGPT can help students draft a paper by utilizing the concept of the two systems of thinking described in Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow

ChatGPT can help students draft a paper by utilizing the concept of the two systems of thinking described by Daniel Kahneman in his book "Thinking, Fast and Slow". The two systems, referred to as System 1 and System 2 thinking, represent the quick, intuitive and emotional versus the deliberate, logical and reflective modes of thinking. By using ChatGPT's language generation capabilities, students can explore and identify instances of System 1 thinking in their paper, and consciously switch to System 2 thinking to revise and improve the reasoning, logic and evidence in their argumentation. ChatGPT can also suggest and provide evidence-based information, allowing students to strengthen their arguments and write more comprehensive and well-supported papers. (Written by ChatGPT)

In this specific scenario I probably couldn't have written the above paragraph any better myself, and saved myself some time figuring out an elegant way of essentially saying: "I think ChatGPT is good for students because it allows them to hack the two systems proposed by Kahneman in his book to be more productive in their writing and gather a starting point for which to organize their thoughts".

Prompt:
>What are potential downsides of students using ChatGPT to write a paper or help with an assignment?

There are several potential downsides of students using ChatGPT to write a paper or help with an assignment:

1. Reliance on technology: Students may become too reliant on ChatGPT and not develop their own critical thinking and writing skills.
2. Lack of originality: ChatGPT's responses are based on pre-existing information and can result in repetitive or unoriginal content.
3. Inaccurate information: ChatGPT may provide incorrect or outdated information if its training data is not current.
4. Limited creativity: ChatGPT's responses are limited by its programming and may not fully capture the student's own unique perspective or ideas
5. Lack of accountability: Using ChatGPT as a writing aid can give students the impression that they can simply copy and paste answers, rather than take responsibility for their own learning and writing.


Therefore, while ChatGPT can be a useful tool in helping students write a paper, it's important for students to use it as a supplement to their own efforts and to verify information provided by the model. (Written by ChatGPT)

I would tend to agree with ChatGPTs input here, and it certainly helped get me over the hump of writer's block when I got to the point of connecting the dots between Kahneman's two systems and where it fits in with students using an AI tools to aid in the writing process. It's helpful to see what all of the fuss is about...

Where I think the hype falls short is how students will use the AI to cheat, and *get away with it*, if anything ChatGPT is exposing how much blatant cheating that has already been going on. What I'm interested in is how we can monitor that cheating, and on the flip-side, what useful metrics can we use to measure critical thinking, and how can ChatGPT be used as a learning tool to learn these skills?

Although ChatGPT is very new and can seem like a terrifying force that will displace jobs, open a wave of cheating and theft of thought, this is a very normal reaction. In my opinion it's a tool that can be used to greatly enhance human creativity and automate the boring part of writing compelling thought.
